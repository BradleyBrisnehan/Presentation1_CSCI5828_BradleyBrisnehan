     <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p>
        The original implementation of Rapid Application Development (RAD) was employed by Dan Gielan at the New York Telephone Company's System Development Center in the mid-1970s.  Upon the project’s success, Gielan proceeded to lecture on the method which would later be known as Competitive Engineering throughout the late 1970s.  While working for IBM in the 1980s, James Martin developmed his method based on Gielan’s.  In 1991 he published his findings in a book titled <i>Rapid Application Development</i>.   In subsequent years, further work in solidification and documentation of the method has taken place.  James Kerr and Richard Hunter wrote <i>Inside RAD</i> which documented the implementation and adaptation of the RAD methodology on a real-life project.

        Rapid Application Development speeds the process by placing less weight on the planning of tasks and more on the development itself.  RAD utilizes prototype implementations along with workshops among developers and the customer to continually revise the requirements.  Timeboxing results in re-scoped yet functional solutions rather than missed deadlines.  With strong application developers employed, this method responds to dynamic requirements to deliver a solution in a timely manner.  RAD methodology is best suited for applications which require a strong user interface.

        <i>"The ability of an information system to evolve to meet new requirements is one of the key quality characteristics, but systems must also be capable of rapid evolution if they are to deliver real value to the business community in this volatile business environment. Systems that cannot evolve rapidly offer little or no support to their users, who in turn become less responsive to their environment and consequently incur increased risk of failure in the marketplace."</i> (Hambling 2000).
